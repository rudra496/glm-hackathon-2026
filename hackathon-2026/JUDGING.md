# Judging Guide

## Scoring Rubric (100 points)

| Criterion | Weight | What Judges Look For |
|---|---:|---|
| Problem Relevance | 20 | Clear, meaningful problem for students/community/industry |
| Solution Quality | 25 | Technical soundness, architecture, and practical utility |
| AI Usage Quality | 15 | Appropriate, meaningful use of AI (not superficial) |
| Execution & Functionality | 20 | Working demo, stability, and completeness |
| Documentation & Presentation | 10 | README clarity, demo quality, explanation |
| Innovation | 10 | Novel angle, thoughtful implementation choices |

## Judge Scoring Scale (per criterion)

- **0–2:** Very weak / missing
- **3–4:** Basic
- **5–6:** Moderate
- **7–8:** Strong
- **9–10:** Excellent

> Final weighted score = sum of each criterion score × criterion weight factor.

## Tie-break Policy

If final scores are tied:

1. Higher **Execution & Functionality** score wins.
2. If still tied, higher **Problem Relevance** score wins.
3. If still tied, judges hold a short discussion and majority decision.

## Judge Conduct

- Score independently before panel discussion.
- Avoid conflicts of interest.
- Provide one-line feedback for each team.
